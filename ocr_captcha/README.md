This example demonstrates a simple OCR model built with the Functional API (from Keras lib). Apart from combining CNN and RNN, it also illustrates how you can instantiate a new layer and use it as an "Endpoint layer" for implementing CTC loss. For a detailed guide to layer subclassing, please check out this page in the developer guides.
